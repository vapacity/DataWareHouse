B000063W1R,The Count of Monte Cristo [Region 2],,English,,,PG,,"Retelling a story that has made it onto the silver screen more than most, this latest adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo makes yet another swashbuckling attempt to win over a new generation of cinema goers. A dashing James Caviezel takes the role of the Count, who is driven by a desire for revenge after being betrayed by his best friend Fernand (played by a dishevelled Guy Pearce) and landed with 16 years of solitary confinement in Chateau D'If, a damp cavernous prison. Thus the scene is set for a good old-fashioned romp. The trouble with this ""re-imagining"" (to borrow a phrase from Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes) is that it's never quite sure whether to take itself seriously or not. Alexandre Dumas's original story is a traditionally melodramatic tale of deceit and double-crossing, with clear-cut bad guys and a moral lesson to be learned at the end. Here, director Kevin Reynolds appears unsure about whether to stick with tradition or bring the story up to date and turn it into a post-modern play on the old Victorian values and style. When the Count and his heavy-breathing loved one are reunited, their kiss is actually framed as a cameo. Both lead actors are also prone to heavy bouts of overacting, garnishing their performances with exaggerated baroque gestures. Clearly this is a film in which the actors could over-indulge themselves and (almost) get away with it, were it not for the fact that--bar Richard Harris as the ""Priest""--none of them seem to have the faintest idea about how to conduct themselves in a period drama. This Count of Monte Cristo will leave the audience a little confused as to whether they should cry along with the story or laugh along with the actors. --Nikki Disney On the DVD: The Count of Monte Cristo on disc offers no escape from the dry drawl of director Kevin Reynolds, who features in almost every element of the extensive extras package. With a shy studio disclaimer before his commentary, he's got a refreshingly frank attitude to",,,,,,Kids & Family,,7.7,1,

In the late 80s, Islamic fundamentalists in Sudan waged war on the countrys separatists, leaving behind over 20,000 male orphans, otherwise known as ""lost boys."" For those who survived this traumatic ordeal and found their way to refugee camps, some were chosen to participate in a resettlement program in America  a distant place so presumably full of hope and opportunity that the Sudanese sometimes call it Heaven. But what if a free ticket to ""Heaven"" turned out to be anything but? Sidestepping conventional voice-over narration in favor of real-time, close-quarters poignancy, Lost Boys of Sudan focuses on Santino and Peter, members of the Dinka tribe, during their first life-altering year in the United States. Safe at last from physical danger  but a world away from home the boys must grapple with extreme cultural differences as they come to understand both the abundance and alienation of contemporary American life.",,,,,,,,7.5,1,

B000H5U5IK,Rediscover Jacques Feyder French Film Master: Queen of Atlantis/Crainquebille/Faces of Children,,English,,,Unrated,6 hours,"Until now, Jacques Feyder has been unjustly reduced almost to a footnote in film history, but these beautifully-restored editions with stunning tints and new orchestral scores reveal him as one of the finest silent film directors in Europe. Following these accomplishments, Feyder was invited to Hollywood in 1929 to direct two outstanding films with Greta Garbo, The Kiss and the German version of Anna Christie, and to London for Marlene Dietrich in Knight without Armour; he is probably best remembered for Carnival in Flanders (La Kermesse heroique, 1935), which, unfortunately, was cut by about one-third for American release. Queen of Atlantis (L'Atlantide), based upon Pierre Benoit's best-selling exotic novel of the French foreign legion and the woman no man can resist, was filmed under grueling conditions on location in the Sahara and in a large tent studio outside of Algiers. The desert, with its burning sun and vast expanse of sand, is the real star of this adventure, the most expensive French film until that time. It was hailed as a revelation, and ran for a year in Paris. Crainquebille is the name of a fruit and vegetable peddler (Maurice de Feraudy) who, accused of having insulted a policeman, becomes trapped in the bureaucratic web of French justice. He is sent to jail; after release, his bourgeois customers shun him, but at the point of suicide he is redeemed by an orphan newsboy (Jean Forest, an amazingly sensitive and expressive child found by Feyder on the streets of Montmartre). Feyder filmed on location around the market area of Les Halles and in some of the oldest areas of Paris. D. W. Griffith allegedly said of Crainquebille, ""I have seen a film which, for me, precisely symbolizes Paris."" Faces of Children (Visages d'enfants), a masterpiece, was filmed on location in the Haut-Valais region of Switzerland, with spectacular mountain scenery adding important atmosphere to the characters' complex emotions.

The good news is that Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King acquit themselves nicely in this concert, recorded on New Year's Eve, 2005 in a Ft. Worth club. Both Texas bluesmen are fine guitarists. Kubek's sound is fast and fiery, with a hard, stinging tone somewhat akin to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, while King's playing is a jazzier, more melodic and idiosyncratic (and thus a little more interesting to listen to); while Kubek takes the lion's share of the soloing, the contrast in styles works best when they trade licks on two extended jams, ""Crazy World"" and ""Where I Want to Be."" King handles all the singing, recalling Albert King, while the rhythm section (Paul Jenkins on bass and drummer Ralph Powers) is solid and workmanlike. So what's not to like? Nothing, really--but there's nothing much to love, either. The eleven original tunes, all of them good but none of them exceptional, are drawn from standard genres (rockin' shuffle, slow ballad, minor key lament), but let's face it: in the absence of outstanding showmanship on anyone's part, we're really here for the guitar playing, and an hour or so of that should prove to be plenty. Extras include interviews with Kubek and King and an all-acoustic bonus track.

B005ZMBBRY,1911,,,,"January 10, 2012",R,,"At the beginning of the 20th century, China is in a state of crisis. The country is split into warring factions, the citizens are starving, and recent political reforms have made matters worse, not better. The ruling Qing Dynasty, led by a seven-year-old emperor, is completely out of touch after 250 years of unquestioned power. With ordinary citizens beginning to revolt openly, the Qing Dynasty has created a powerful, modern army (the New Army) to quash any rebellion. But weapons are expensive, and desperate for cash, the Qing leaders are trading anything they can get their hands on with foreign countries... and selling China's future in the process. Huang Xin (Jackie Chan) has recently returned from Japan, where he has studied the art of modern warfare. When he finds his country falling apart, he feels he has no choice but to pick up the sword, leading an increasingly desperate series of violent rebellions against the powerful Qing Dynasty and the New Army - several with tragic consequences. From the walls of the Forbidden City to the battlefields of China, with no expense spared in production and no detail ignored in it's quest for historical accuracy, 1911 is a true epic in every sense of the word.",,"Jackie Chan, Bingbing Li, Joan Chen, Winston Chao",,,,,,,2,Well Go Usa

The fuse of conflict has been lit. Bad blood between the two medieval realms will seethe and explode into all-out war. One of the most unusual of the many Italian-made spectacles to roll across American movie screens in the early 1960s is also one of the most thunderously action-filled. Versatile filmmaker Richard Thorpe, who a decade earlier guided the power and pomp of Ivanhoe and The Prisoner of Zenda, here stages eye-catching production pieces that include a libidinous night of pageantry and revelry at Burundai's court, the tumultuous sweep and clash of horse-mounted armies across the Russian steppes and the savage sword-to-axe siege of a blazing Viking fort.

There, he made a name for himself as a film composer and only rarely wrote great works for the stage. Many of his quite successful operas, composed between 1913 and 1927, stopped being performed after World War II. Among these was his perhaps most significant work, Die tote Stadt (The Dead City), which was performed again for the first time after a long hiatus in 1955 in Munich. Further productions followed. Nevertheless, Götz Friedrich's version of 1983 for the Deutsche Oper Berlin was only the fifth new production of the opera after 1945. Thanks to it, the work became established in the repertoires of many other opera houses, if only as a curiosity.In the production at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1983, James King, who debuted at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1961 and had a great interest in the role, starred as Paul; the internationally renowned singer Karan Armstrong as Marietta; and William Murray as Frank.",,"James King, Karan Armstrong, William Murray, Sylvia Greenberg, Heinrich Hollreiser",,,,,,,1,Arthaus

Now you can follow every government conspiracy, alien abduction, and hidden truth right from the beginning. In Black Oil, even as Scully searches for the truth behind her abduction, an alien autopsy tape leads her and Mulder to a professed group of women abductees who all have chips identical to the one found in Scully's neck. Then, while investigating a series of deaths connected to a sunken World War II aircraft and a mysterious black oil, Mulder encounters Alex Krycek, who claims to have a digital tape documenting the existence of extraterrestrials. A second encounter with Krycek leads Mulder to Siberia, where an unidentified object crashed into Earth in 1908. Yet for all the seemingly undeniable proof, when agents are asked to verify the remains of a 200-year-old-alien, they finally discover just how far the government will go to make Mulder believe.",,,,,,,,8.6,,

B00008G1PX,Cinderella [VHS],,,,,G,1 hour and 16 minutes,"Disney's adaptation of the beloved fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including ""A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,"" ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,"" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. We all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. There are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly Cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous Disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named Lucifer. There's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the King and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying. --David Kronke",,,,,NTSC,"Animation, Anime & Manga",,,,Fox Video

That war is more a distant rumor than a direct concern of people with cabins to raise, crops to harvest, and firstborn on the way. When it comes to their valley, in the form of hitherto-peaceable Indians whipped up by a gaunt Tory with an eyepatch (John Carradine), life changes as though with the passing of a cloud shadow. In this, his first color film, Ford created indelible images of the dawning of America: a lone wagon making its way through acres of long grass rippling in the wind; the Indians, at the onset of their first raid, seeming to materialize out of the mist, out of the very trunks of trees; a ragged line of farmers with flintlocks passing along a split-rail fence, then resolving into a column, an army, marching toward a distant horizon. (Utah's Wasatch mountain country stands in persuasively for upstate New York in pioneer days.) Edna May Oliver scored a best-supporting-actress Oscar nomination as a memorably crusty frontier widow, while Ward Bond--oddly omitted from the opening credits--claimed a place of honor in the John Ford Stock Company playing Fonda's best friend.",,"Fonda, Colbert",,,,,,7.0,,20th Century Fox

This exquisitely crafted inquiry into the rationale of this mythic figure situates him within a late 20th Century web of technology - a system that he grew to oppose. A marvelously subversive approach to the history of the Internet, this insightful documentary combines speculative travelogue and investigative journalism to trace contrasting counter cultural responses to the cybernetic revolution. For those who resist these intrusive systems of technological control, the Unabomber has come to symbolize an ultimate figure of Refusal. For those that embrace it, as did and do the early champions of media art like Marshall McLuhan, Nam June Paik, and Stewart Brand, the promises of worldwide networking and instantaneous communication outweighed the perils. Dambeck's conceptual quest links these multiple nodes of cultural and political thought like the Internet itself. Circling through themes of utopianism, anarchism, terrorism, CIA, LSD, MK-ULTRA, Tim Leary, Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, THE NET exposes conspiracies and upheavals, secrets and cover-ups along the way.","Eva Mattes, Thomas Vogt, Theodore John Kaczynski, Butch Gehring, Henry A.

She has retired and wants the tradition to continue through her daughter Sakina. One evening, a skirmish breaks out in the neighborhood and Sardari is killed in an accidental stone missile. Due to tension of the forthcoming elections, her funeral becomes a media event. A repoter Tehzeeb Abbasi is sent by the editor Mark D'Cruz to cover the funeral. Tehzeeb was shocked to see her father Jabbar Abbasi among the mourners; and that Sardari Begum was his sister. She had been disowned by the family for learning music from a courtesan. Due to her passion for music, she ran away from home and ended up as a mistress of a local landlord, and later led a life as a successful singer. Intrigued with her aunt's history, Tehzeeb sets out to collect material from people who were close to Sardari Begum. She discovers in Sardari's chequered life a startling parallel with her own predicament. As the film ends, Sakina goes back to her singing. Tehzeeb breaks away from Mark.

B003NEQ74S,Phenomena [DVD] [1985],,English,,"June 29, 2011",R,1 hour and 20 minutes,"Italian horror maestro Dario Argento made his name by turning homicide into modern art with a cinematic flourish, but with Phenomena he takes his stylish mayhem in new directions. The film opens with the dreamy grace of a fairy tale: a young girl wandering the green meadows of Switzerland and discovering a gingerbread house, wherein lives a monster more modern than mythic, a psychopathic maniac who plunges the picture into a lush nightmare. Jennifer (Jennifer Connelly in her first starring role), a gifted young girl at a Swiss school, has a psychic link to the insect world and develops a connection with the killer through midnight sleepwalks. With the help of a lonely, wheelchair-bound entomologist (genre stalwart Donald Pleasence, who inflects his sonorous tenor with a gentle Scottish burr) she turns telekinetic detective, which only draws her closer to the killer's lair. The densely plotted story becomes muddled at times (this is the busiest film in Argento's oeuvre) but the lyrical cinematography and gorgeous nocturnal imagery--dreamy sleepwalks, nightmarish murders, hideous horrors that emerge in the dark of night--take on a poetic elegance not seen in his previous work, providing the tale with a kind of dream logic.

Siegel (Warren Beatty in a flashy performance) arrives in California in the Forties, assigned to oversee the L.A. rackets. He is quickly seduced by both the glamour of Hollywood and actress Virginia Hill (Annette Bening), whom he romances despite being unable to leave his wife and children. Siegel soon has a vision to transform a barren stretch of Nevada desert into an oasis of gambling and entertainment -- the seeds from which Las Vegas was sown. Funded by his gangster bosses, including Meyer Lansky (Ben Kingsley), the flamboyant Siegel sees his budget soar past its original $6 million, a problem compounded by the fact that Virginia has embezzled $2 million of it. In trouble with his superiors, Siegel flies back to L.A. to face the music, telling Virginia to keep the money. He would not live to see his dream of Las Vegas come true. The film is fast-paced and well-directed by Barry Levinson, with an intelligent script by James Toback and excellent support from Kingsley and Harvey Keitel as gangster Mickey Cohen.

There is no other method that can match how the extra-long center-pin rods and super-smooth single-action reels allow a float to run. The reason you now see both tackle and fly shops stocking up on center-pin gear is that ""The Secret is Out"". This technique, developed by European Tournament anglers decades ago, is now producing sensational results on a wide variety of North American species. It is said that fish have a small brain but huge instincts. It's instinct that tells a fish not to take when a presentation isn't completely natural. Center-pin float fishing gives you the perfect presentation...BAR None. Hosting this one-of-a-kind production is Mike Perusse. Mike is an exceptional angler who has guided professionally and now represents G. Loomis Rods in the Northwest.

B0001A9JEW,Mr. Mike's Mondo Video [VHS],,,,,R,1 hour and 15 minutes,"""From the twisted genius behind Saturday Night Live s early years, Mr. Mike s Mondo Video is the wildly demented comedy from the mind of National Lampoons and Saturday Night Lives notoriously funny writer/performer Michael O Donoghue. And like most of O Donoghue s humor, it was years ahead of its time. Originally conceived in 1979 as a television special slotted for one of Saturday Night Lives hiatuses, with much of the Saturday Night Live cast on board, it was summarily rejected by NBC as too outrageous for broadcast. Unseen for years."" Mike O'Donoghue's parody of ""Mondo Cane"" showcases curious performers, strange musicians, celebrity mutations and unusual short films, including Thomas Alva Edison's ""Elephant Electrocution"". ""The original Saturday Night Live crew were known as the ""Not Ready for Prime Time Players,"" but when it came to Mr. Mike’s Mondo Video, they weren’t ready for television at all. ""Mr. Mike"" is Michael O'Donoghue, SNL’s original head writer, and his twisted sensibility concocted this item, which features cast members Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Laraine Newman, and Jane Curtin (along with the likes of Carrie Fisher, Margot Kidder, and Debbie Harry) and was intended for NBC; when the network balked at airing it, it was released theatrically. NBC’s objections are understandable--some of this stuff is pretty raunchy--but if you like your humor ""vile, degrading, and repulsive,"" as O’Donoghue proudly describes it, you’ve come to the right place. Produced in 1979, the rag-tag 70-minute collection was apparently intended as a spoof of Mondo Cane, the 1962 Italian ""shockumentary"" depicting various depraved and bizarre acts, and while it isn’t consistently hilarious, to say the least, Mondo Video has something to offend pretty much everyone. It’s hard to imagine the folks at PETA, for example, being too happy about the ""Cat Swimming School"" segment, which consists of nothing more than terrified kitties being thrown into a pool; nor will a scen",,"Michael O'Donoghue, Dan Aykroyd",,,NTSC,Comedy,,4.9,,

New York City, 1914. Modern progress confronts the oppressive prohibitions of the past. Moral crusaders enforce rigid laws banning ""obscene"" materials - including literature on safe sex and family planning. The result: desperate women with too little money and too many children risking their lives to end unwanted pregnancies. Working as a nurse in New York's poorest neighborhoods, Margaret Sanger (Dana Delany, China Beach) boldly fights to end this epidemic of ignorance. However, zealots led by the formidable Anthony Comstock (Rod Steiger, On the Waterfront), Chairman of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, are determined to stop her rebellious campaign. Facing prison - and making headlines - for daring to voice her opinions, Sanger is forced to part with her loving husband (Henry Czerny, The Ice Storm), three children and flee the country.

B00005U14C,Shaolin Wooden Men... Young Tiger's Revenge,,English,,,Unrated,1 hour and 38 minutes,"This was Jet Li's second movie and was once again a Mainland Chinese production. The tone is on the opposite end of Shaolin Temple's: light-hearted and fun. The movie tells the story of two families on different sides of a river: Yu Hai's family of Shaolin martial arts'trained boys(one of whom is Jet Li) and another guy's family of Wudang (Wu Tang) swordsmanship-trained girls. There's been a rivalry between the families and that's interfering with the wedding between various members of the families who love each other. Also, there are some vicious bandits who want revenge after Yu Hai rescued the boys and injured their leader. The cast is made up of authentic wushu stylists, and it shows. Everyone knows how to fight in this movie. The little girls, the little boys, the men, the women, the thieves, etc. Therefore, all the action is pure, authentic Chinese martial arts (pole, sword, 3-sectional staff, etc). The choreography is a lot different than people today are used to. However, if you like your fighting w/o extensive use of wire and special FX, this is definitely worth checking out. My only gripe is that Jet Li has to compete with the rest of the cast in showing off his skills. The main flaw of this film is that although everyone in the cast are martial artists, the ensemble casting and numerous sub-plots take away from character development and not every subplot gets to be developed. The story jumps from one character's story to the next, and therefore not everyone gets to be fully developed. I must say that the story and the children made the film more endearing. Jet Li is probably at his most likable (he's up there with his performance in Fong Sai Yuk). The little children are pretty enjoyable little scamps, just don't go into the film expecting a dead-serious martial arts movie. It's light-hearted and fancy free.","Kong Kim, Biao Yuen, Chi-Hwa Chen, Kam Chiang, Jang Lee Hwang, Yuen Lung, Jackie Chan, Tien Miao, Wei Ho Tu","Jackie Chan, Kam Chiang, Jang Lee Hwang, Kong Kim, Yuen Lung",,,"Color, Multiple Formats, NTSC",Kids & Family,,6.3,,Beverly Wilshire

The emphasis here is on learning ballet from the inside out.

Learn to ""see and feel"" what you are doing. Learn the ""why and how"" that create the ""what."" Teachers have found that this class works wonders with younger students. EXERCISES: 1. Number One; 2.

ABOUT THE VIDEO: As Finis Jhung often says in class, “you either stand up, or you fall. You either balance, or you don’t. It all comes from the way you do your barrework.” As you do this carefully constructed and minutely detailed barre, Finis frequently asks Kelley Waddell of The American Ballet Theatre (and you) to see if she can continue doing an exercise with her hand off the barre. Sometimes, he asks her to check and see that she’s not sitting back on her heel, because he wants her to feel she’s always ready to move from that position. Kelley works at a portable barre which has been placed in front of the mirror, because Finis thinks it’s very important for you learn to see what he sees, so that you will eventually be able to correct yourself. Throughout each exercise, Finis is right at Kelley’s side, providing directions and corrections. Go beyond the positions and the terminology—learn to move! The CD music is by Scott Killian.

Babies being fascinated with the faces of other babies is not a new concept. In the late 1990s this simple concept was featured on major television shows, such as Oprah and 20/20. ""Face2Face"" is recommended for young infants who are not yet overly active. It simply presents real babies, with no puppets, animation, twirlies, or commercialism. Babies in their infancy are mesmerized from the moment they can see their own reflection in a mirror, and this video is full of expressive faces looking right back at them - each with their own unique look and individual personality. The bold and bright colors also play a part in attracting an infant's or toddler's attention.

Over the past fifty years, scientists have made a series of remarkable discoveries which show that the universe is fine-tuned to make human life possible. This is genuinely new evidence that points to the reality of the Creator. As professor Paul Davies says, 'the impression of design is overwhelming.'

ORIGINALLY ENTITLED 2 MAN URBAN OPERATIONS, IT IS BY FAR THE MOST ADVANCED OF THE 3 LOTAR DVDs. THE SKILLS TAUGHT ARE BASED ON THE STRONG FOUNDATION OF THE FIRST TWO DVDs (PISTOL AND RIFLE) AND MASTERY OF THE PISTOL AND RIFLE AS AN INDIVIDUAL, BOTH IN THE OPEN RANGE, AND IN THE SHOOT HOUSE. THIS FILM COVERS VIRTUALLY EVERY GEOMETRIC CONFIGURATION THAT COULD BE FACED WHEN FIGHTING IN A STRUCTURE. THE DVD TEACHES TWO PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER COVERING EACH OTHER WHILE WORKING IN THE STRUCTURE. ENTERING ROOMS OF ALL SIZES AND COVERING ONE ANOTHER IS THE IDEA OF THE DVD. FIRST YOU BUILD THE INDIVIDUAL, THEN THE PAIR, THEN THE TEAM. THIS DVD TAKES IT ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL. IF YOU HAVE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE THEN YOU CAN WATCH THIS DVD AND UNDERSTAND ITS SERIOUSNESS. ORIGINALLY THIS DVD WAS LIMITED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MILITARY BUT WE REEDITED THE FILM IN ORDER TO RELEASE IT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. FOR THE SERIOUS WARRIOR IT IS A REAL TREAT. GARRET AND ELI, DEMONSTRATE AND EXPLAIN ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE TACTICAL SCENARIOS DEPICTED. THIS IS THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF COUNTER TERROR WORK. AFTER THE STUDENTS HAVE MASTERED THE SKILLS TAUGHT IN THE THREE DVDs THEY CAN FEEL CONFIDENT IN DEALING WITH ALL BUILT UP AREA ENCOUNTERS.

In a fit of teenage provocation, the three girls swear that they will lose their virginity by the day of the procession of the Madonna. To make matters worse, each of them has her eyes on a boy of a different religion, thus challenging an inviolable taboo. This leads the three families to cut off all ties with one another.

B00005KA8M,Rebel Music - The Bob Marley Story [VHS],,English,,"June 26, 2001",,,"The legend of Bob Marley (1945-1981) is well served by this comprehensive and clear-eyed look at the turbulent life and times of the reggae great. Jeremy Marre's documentary presents the man as a vitally important artist, but a flawed--if immensely appealing--human being. The trajectory of his rise is traced from his humble beginnings as the son of a poor, teenage mother in rural Jamaica to the heights of international superstardom in the 1970s. Along the way, Marre provides a context for the development of his artistry by exploring the political situation in Jamaica at the time, the roots of Rastafarianism (to which he was intensely devoted), and his unconventional relationships with women. Although he remained close to wife, Rita, until his death, Marley enjoyed a number of public relationships with other women (Rita admits she found this difficult; Marley claims he didn't see anything unusual about it). The sheer number of interviews is impressive. Aside from the clips of Marley himself, Bunny Livingstone and Peter Tosh (the Wailers), Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, two Jamaican prime ministers (Socialist Michael Manley and Conservative Edward Seaga), and even a CIA official (Philip Agee) all make an appearance. The breadth of Marley's music is represented by over 40 tracks, from the early ska hit ""Judge Not"" to later political numbers like ""Africa Unite."" Although Marley never actually considered himself a ""political"" person, he was surely a rebel--brave, passionate, committed--in the best sense of the word.

Composers such as Mendelssohn and Mozart have performed there and Wagner was baptized there, but certainly the greatest works ever done there are the compositions of J.S. Bach. The organ featured in this recital by Mr. Böhme is a restoration of the Sauer organ which was first built in 1889 by Wilhelm Sauer. The restoration was begun in 1988 by Christian Scheffler, who reconstructed original mixtures and some of the other altered stops. Plans have been made to restore the organ to its 1908 disposition. The program Mr. Böhme has chosen includes some of Bachs Organ Chorales, Prelude and Fuge in A minor and ""Jesu, bleibet meine Freude"" and several other of Bachs familiar and not so familiar compositions. This church and organ are important pieces of European culture both musically and historically.",,,,,"NTSC, Classical, Multiple Formats, Color",Music Videos & Concerts,,,,Kultur Video

B000ZLFALI,Across the Universe,,,,"February 5, 2008",PG-13,,"Given a track record littered by misfired oddities like the Bee Gees starring in the 1978 movie version of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, successfully transforming The Beatles' epochal oeuvre into film musicals has been an elusive alchemy. Yet director Julie Taymor's 1968-centered, socio-political romance is more than just a stunning visual achievement. Its soundtrack brings a crucially intimate, emotionally engaging sensibility to its rich catalog of Beatles source material. Using an approach she rightly dubbed ""organic,"" Taymor never gets too ambitious with the original arrangements, balancing the plaintive, often stark performances of central young stars Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood with equally compelling turns by supporting players Carol Woods and Joe Anderson. The stars successfully evoke early Beatlemania via the energetic charms of Sturgess' ""All My Loving"" and Wood's ""It Won't Be Long,"" then get straight to the canon's often melancholy heart on his take of ""In My Life,"" and her gentle cover of ""Blackbird."" Taymor's use of star turns--the entire point of too many Beatles-rooted projects--is as sparing as it is deft. Eddie Izzard's effusive ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" is the product of several edited improvisations, while U2's Bono and Edge re-imagine ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" by way of Pink Floyd. Joe Cocker's swamp-dirge ""Come Together"" shows why he's long been one of the best interpreters of the Lennon-McCartney catalog, and Dana Fuchs alternately evokes the heavenly and hellish via her tender ""Dear Prudence,"" as well as her manic, Joplin-channeling burn through ""Helter Skelter."" Elsewhere on the CD, Bono teams with Secret Machine for the straightforward ""I Am the Walrus,"" while the Dallas indie rockers also take dream-pop turns on the instrumental ""Flying"" and George Harrison's haunting ""Blue Jay Way."" Remarkably, Taymor claims the bulk of the performances here were not lip-synced, but recorded live as the cameras rolled.

While earning an MFA at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles during the mid-1950s, Paul Soldner challenged the established aesthetic in ceramics--much like the New York painters, such as Jackson Pollock did with Abstract Expressionism. It was during this Otis Movement that ceramic art graduated from functional craft to fine art. At the forefront of this revolutionary period was Paul Soldner, pushing the boundaries of both clay and kiln. Today, at 84 and after decades of teaching his skills to younger generations, Paul remains on the cutting edge of modern ceramic sculpture. He pushes no one harder than himself, understanding that the only limitation is one s own imagination. His unique persona, gentle and wise yet playfully unconventional, clearly challenges the norm and inspires more than just ceramic artists, but whomever encounters this eccentric sage.",,Paul Soldner,,,,,,8.3,1,Passion River

This unprecedented release has been digitally mastered with the approval of the Zapruder family. An accompanying documentary, which explores the mastering process in detail, features a short portrait of Zapruder and a fascinating history of the film's official and unofficial showings up to the present. The tape also includes a frame-by-frame analysis of the film, a chronology of events, and additional historical video.

B000VZC4X0,Naked Beneath the Water,,,,"February 5, 2008",Unrated,1 hour and 25 minutes,"Reality television gets even more extreme with Public Enemy, a phony (but spookily possible somewhere in the near future) TV show featured in this film where hot, up and coming serial killers and mass murderers air video footage of their heinous acts, duking it out for the honor of being crowned top killer of the year. Public Enemy plays a big part in the movie as our hero, Pelle, receives a strange phone call one day that orders him to begin watching the gruesome show. While many of us would be thankful for the tip, for Pelle, this phone call comes one month after the mysterious disappearance of his brother. During a particularly nasty episode, Pelle recognizes his brother's apartment being used as the setting for a chainsaw murder, so he moves into his residence and begins trying to solve the mystery of his disappearance...and the brutal chainsaw scene...and the reason why all of the people living in this apartment complex are total f**king freaks. There's a lot of figuring out here to do, for Pelle and for the audience. The film tosses everyone around in this spastic cinematic stew that resembles Natural Born Killers on fire. Mix that with this kind of Argento-like giallo feel and there's a lot to handle here. So it's paramount that you give the film your undivided attention. This isn't a casual viewing with your buddies on a Friday night, drinking beer and making yo mama jokes. Naked Beneath the Water desires your full attention, and if you re generous enough, you'll find it giving you in return quite a nasty little thrill ride, perverse and untamed. So untamed, in fact, that the film seems to be falling apart at the seams at times. You can almost sense a filmmaker's nervous breakdown happening behind the camera and that makes this movie all the more unsettling to digest as concerned you are about Pelle's plight, you re also wondering about the mental state of the filmmaker and you become frightened of them. I love that kind of filmmaking and Naked Beneath the Water is a sight to behold. --Eric Campos, Film Threat",,"Bonnie Steiger, Richard Teran, Sean Cain",,,,,,2.5,,Hannover House

The film depicts a sometimes reluctant, self-doubting Jesus, gradually coming to accept His divinity and the inexorability of His ultimate fate. The much-maligned sex scene with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) occurs as an hallucination experienced by Jesus as he suffers on the cross. This particular sequence was what infuriated the film's most rabid critics, but in fact it is just one of many iconoclastic musings to be found in the film and its source novel. Equally volatile are the intimations that, as a carpenter, Jesus indifferently shaped the crucifixes for other condemned prisoners long before his own fate was sealed, and that Judas (Harvey Keitel) was literally manipulated into betrayal by a Christ whose preoccuption with his own destiny compelled him to 'use' others. None of these departures from the normal interpretation of the scriptures are offered as any more than theory; as such, it was accepted as food for thought by the more open-minded clerics and Biblical scholars who recommended the film.

It has Bruce Li. The film is about a character sometimes called Bob, sometimes called Bruce, and sometimes called Mr. Lee. The synopsis refers to the main character as Bruce Lee. When Bruce Lee first came to the United States, he began teaching Wing Chun kung fu. He, with many martial talents, soon found himself in the midst of a well established kung fu society that didn't take kindly to his outspoken mannerisms. It wasn't long before his abilities were challenged by a hired group of body-bashers. Like a streak of lightning, he served them all a flurry of knuckle sandwiches which didn't go down too lightly with their boss. Not too long after this incident, the ""Little Dragon"" became the target of a hired professional exterminator. Although surviving the encounter, Bruce had discovered that his Wing Chun style was not suitable for American street fighting. More determined than ever, he began to search for a new method of combat. Thus, the ""way of the intercepting fist"" (Jeet Kune Do) was born. The way that is no way and the style that becomes no style is portrayed in a tremendous climax of bone-crushing kung fu techniques which leave little doubt as to the proficiency of Bruce Lee's new and deadly art.",,"Bruce Li, Carter Wong, Chang Kuei, Chi-Min Chin, Alan Ellerton",,,,,,5.2,1,World Video

Conan the Barbarian (1982 Film) Conan the Barbarian, the movie that turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a global superstar, is a prime example of a match made in heaven. It's the movie that macho maverick writer-director John Milius was born to make, and Arnold was genetically engineered for his role as the muscle-bound, angst-ridden hero created in Robert E. Howard's pulp novels. Oliver Stone contributed to Milius's screenplay, and the production design by comic artist Ron Cobb represents a perfect cinematic realization of Howard's fantasy world. To avenge the murder of his parents, Conan tracks down the evil Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) with the help of Queen Valeria (played by buff B-movie vixen Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai the Mongol (Gerry Lopez). Aptly described by critic Roger Ebert as ""the perfect fantasy for the alienated pre-adolescent,"" this blockbuster is just as enjoyable for adults who haven't lost their youthful imagination. --Jeff Shannon",,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Earl Jones, Max von Sydow, Sandahl Bergman, Ben Davidson",,,,,,,,MCA / Universal

To help you focus, Jessica Sherwood breaks the toning into specific section(e.g. ""balance,"" ""abs,"" ""center barre-work""). Then, she carefully - but quickly - demos each move one-on-one before moving into the full class workout. The ending cardio segment features a non-stop series of graceful, flowing ballet movements. Throughout, the terminology and attitude is pure ballet (""now we'll add a weight transfer...""). Music by Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Bach. Note: Different exercises, a little less ""artsy"" and slightly more intense than the original ""BalletBootCamp."" ©2002. (87 min.).

When he attempts to transmit his own body, he accidentally allows a fly into the chamber, and the resulting man-insect hybrid runs rampant across the Canadian countryside. Philippe, the son of that ill-fated scientist, is told the family history by a benevolent uncle (an oddly prim Vincent Price); possessed with the scientific will-to-know, he becomes determined to re-create his father's experiments. The legendarily silly costuming of the original Fly returns, and with it, the perplexing logic of transmogrification--it becomes difficult to decipher which of the man-insect hybrids we're meant to understand as possessing Phillipe's agency. The film is hampered by the lack of a strong female lead, and by performances by all principals that are disappointingly modern in their clear motivation and restraint.

B0006IWQIU,AVP: Alien vs. Predator,,English,,,R,,"In delivering non-18-rated excitement, Alien vs. Predator is an acceptably average science-fiction action thriller with some noteworthy highlights, even if it squanders its opportunity to intelligently combine two popular franchises. Rabid fans can justifiably ask ""Is that all there is?"" after a decade of development hell and eager anticipation, but we're compensated by reasonably logical connections to the Alien legacy and the still-kicking Predator franchise (which hinted at AVP rivalry at the end of Predator 2); some cleverly claustrophobic sets, tense atmosphere and impressive digital effects; and a climactic AVP smackdown that's not half bad. This disposable junk should've been better, but nobody who's seen Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil should be surprised by writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson's lack of imagination. As a brisk, 90-minute exercise in generic thrills, however, Anderson's work is occasionally impressive... right up to his shameless opening for yet another sequel. --Jeff Shannon",,,,,,Mystery & Thrillers,,5.7,2,

B000CNESZ8,Jan Akkerman: A Touch of Class - TV Documentary,,English,,"January 31, 2006",Unrated,,"NTSC/Region 0. Set up at short notice, this Jan Akkerman concert was filmed at Virgin Records 'The Venue' as a Christmas Special, one night after Tina Turner's massively successful six week residency. It is this London concert footage of Akkerman that forms the basis of this DVD. The Jan Ackerman Band of 1983 included Hans Waterman from Solution and Cubby & the Blizzards, bassist Dino Walcott and occasional keyboards player Mark Van Deer Greer. The music featured in this DVD is almost exclusively taken from two albums - Jan's then current offering Can't Stand Noise and Tabernakel - the first album of five solo albums Akkerman released with Atlantic Records throughout the 70's. The production not only features highlights of the performance at the Venue but also Jan in conversation discussing his music that he candidly describes as adapted from the best of baroque and black music. Somewhat understandably included within the film is the reference point of BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test footage of Akkerman playing 'Sylvia' and 'Hocus Pocus' with Focus in 1973.

When a BOPE mission to stop a jail riot ends in violence, Nascimento finds his job on the line--and BOPE accused of a massacre by human rights activists. But a public fed up with the violence and gangs that plague Rio loves it, and Nascimento finds himself embraced as a hero who gets results. With elections around the corner, he's promoted to Sub-Secretary of Intelligence. In his powerful new post, Nascimento strengthens BOPE and brings the drug gangs that run the slum to their knees-- only to come to the sobering realization that by doing so, he's only made things easier for the corrupt cops and dirty politicians who are truly running the game. After years in the trenches, Nascimento now finds that his new enemies are much more dangerous and, even worse, sitting at desks just down the hall. Since its release earlier this year, ELITE SQUAD: THE ENEMY WITHIN has become the most popular film of all time in South America (out-grossing even AVATAR).

B001068GF4,Ski Movie,,,,"November 1, 2000",PG,1 hour,"This showcase for some of the world's most fearless skiers benefits from beautiful camera work, a thumping soundtrack, and a skewed sense of humor. Masters of extreme skiing, including Jonny Mosely, Shane McConkey, and Seth Morrison, go hurtling down mountainsides so close to vertical that no normal person would think of skiing them. And of course the glorious footage, often shot from helicopters, makes it all seem absurdly easy. The genuine danger of this snowy showboating is illustrated in a segment in which Dean Cummings, while making a jump on a mountainside in Alaska, makes a slight error that sends him careening out of control. ""I was dealt a pretty hard blow while tearing it,"" he comments, noting that he was lucky to come away with only a broken leg. A spectacular scene in which skiers are shown gracefully cavorting so high that they can look down on the clouds helps explain why people would be driven to such extremes. And for those who just can't get enough of a rush on skis, a comical sequence features intrepid and insane fellows who up the ante by roaring down impossible slopes on snowmobiles. Just about everything in Ski Movie is something you shouldn't even think about doing yourself, and that's what makes it so entertaining.","Seth Morrison, Jonny Moseley, Shane McConkey, along with Brad Holmes plus all the biggest names in skiing, Matchstick Productions, Vincent Dorion","Seth Morrison, Shane McConkey, Vincent Dorion, Jonny Moseley, along with Brad Holmes plus all the biggest names in skiing",,,,,,,,Matchstick Productions

Allen plays Fielding Mellish, a nebbish unwilling to commit to anything--until he meets Nancy, played by Louise Lasser. Mellish soon finds himself fighting with guerrilla forces in the small third world country of San Marcos, and he becomes an international figure, even appearing on ABC's WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS with Howard Cosell (who plays himself). The film is loaded with sight gags that pay homage to Chaplin, Bergman, and the Marx Brothers. It also tackles politics, government, and religion, even breaking for a commercial for cigarettes endorsed by the church! One of the most memorable scenes of Allen's career occurs when Mellish defends himself in the funniest courtroom scene since the Three Stooges' DISORDER IN THE COURT. Allen's obsessions with food, sex, and death begin to take form here, on their way to becoming major themes in such films as LOVE AND DEATH, ANNIE HALL, and HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.",,Woody Allen,,,"NTSC, Closed-captioned, Color, HiFi Sound",Romance,,6.9,,MGM (Video & DVD)

(1995) caused nary a blip on the media-saturated cultural radar screen that it criticized. Stephen Dorff stars as Cliff Spab, an aimless, hard-drinking youth. Spab becomes a national hero when he is one of several people held hostage by gun-toting terrorists in a convenience store. He doesn't care much about his own life or anything else, and his attitude of ""So f---ing what?"" translates into debates with his terrorist captors and gloomy pronouncements that charm viewers. After a month-long siege, a crisis erupts when the store runs out of beer and junk food, so Cliff finds himself a free man whose celebrity image is emblazoned on t-shirts and whose presence is requested at a rock concert where he is required to do nothing other than appear. In the meantime, Spab's girlfriend Wendy (Reese Witherspoon) becomes a ubiquitous talk show guest. Ostensibly a satire of the celebrity-obsessed culture of the 1990s, the film was withheld from distribution for a year because of thematic similarities to Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994).","Richard Portnow, Jefery Levy, Danny Rubin, Gloria Lopez, Lela Ivey, Reese Witherspoon, Jake Busey, David Barry Gray, Pamela Gidley, Michael Nelson, Annie McEnroe, Joey Lauren Adams, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Dale Pollock, Stephen Dorff, Jack Noseworthy, Sigurjon Sighvatsson, Edward Wiley, Andrew Wellman","Stephen Dorff, Reese Witherspoon, Jake Busey, Joey Lauren Adams, Pamela Gidley",,,"Color, HiFi Sound, NTSC, Closed-captioned",Music Videos & Concerts,,5.7,,Polygram Video

Seasons 3 & 4 (fall 1982 through spring 1983) continue to exploit the razor-sharp wit of Britain's Cosgrove/Hall Production cartoon of the world's smallest superhero. The two-disc set contains 14 episodes shown in their UK format as five four-minute installments (each with its own opening and closing titles/credits). Here, we find Danger Mouse--""that modern day knight in shining white Terylene""--pitted against such nefarious characters as Baron Greenback, Count Duckula, and the Demon from the 4th Dimension. Perilous adventures include ""The Invasion of Colonel K"" when DM faces strange denizens after Greenback shrinks himself and enters K's body to learn his secrets. Adding to the anarchy, two stories contain cameo appearances by Agent 57 and Professor Squakencluck. DM twice goes stateside, in ""Tower of Terror"" when he gets trapped in a New York skyscraper; and ""The Trip to America"" where a Texan helps him retrieve the world's most famous buildings that vanished in a single zap. The under-8 crowd will relish DM's crime-fighting gadgetry and eccentric escapades while older viewers are sure to savor the parodies--those renowned tongue-in-cheek nods to Dr. Who, Monty Python, and Sherlock Holmes. Bonus material is underwhelming, including character biographies and a Karaoke version of the theme song.

This 'novelty act' of the psychedelic circuit evolved into Hot Tuna, and Jesse Block's concert documentary, 25 Years and Runnin', celebrates the simple sustaining powers of blues, bars, and Tuna. Jorma and Jack reflect on their influences and musical partnership since playing in a high school garage band, while their fans explain the Jorma/Jack chemistry that's kept them tuned into Tuna for a quarter century. The documentary's subtitle, Live at Sweetwater (a Bay Area landmark club), is the crux of this DVD, 'live' performances of ragtime blues standards and Tuna originals that exemplify the free spirit that's kept Hot Tuna runnin' all these years. Jorma and Jack are ably assisted by Tuna mates Michael Falzarano (guitar, vocals, mandolin) and Pete Sears (keyboards, accordion).

B00005U8EX,World History of Organized Crime [VHS],,English,,"January 29, 2002",Unrated,4 hours and 10 minutes,"This enthralling History Channel production looks at both the origins and current state of organized crime in Sicily, Russia, Colombia, India, and China. The series of five shows is thoroughly researched and beautifully put together, clearly elucidating the complex sociological roots that gave rise to today's cartels. Such fascinating topics as Russian prison tattoos and the ancient Indian Thug cult are discussed along the way. Though the producers don't shy away from pointing out governmental missteps that have inadvertently assisted in the rise of organized crime, the series comes down firmly on the side of law and order, and is careful to show the ruthlessness and brutality of the black market. The only hitches in the series come in the form of quick repetitions of information (that once followed commercial breaks), but these are only occasionally noticeable. Though densely informative, The World History of Organized Crime never becomes dull or dry--indeed, once you start watching it, it's almost impossible to stop.","Pinki Virani, Dawood Ibrahim, Rakesh Roshan, Scott Alexander (VIII), Hrithik Roshan, Parama Roy, Shobha De","Pinki Virani, Dawood Ibrahim, Rakesh Roshan, Parama Roy, Shobha De",,,"NTSC, Color",Mystery & Thrillers,,7.3,,A&E Home Video

A gang of young slacker guys (the Gakis) idle away their time just hanging out, their sole passion in life being elaborate karaoke recreations of their favorite Showa-era songs (oldies from the 40s to the 80s).Across town, a group of thirty-something divorced women calling themselves the Midoris do much the same thing, until one of the Gakis kills a Midori after he's rejected trying to pick her up. The Midoris retaliate, and the absurdist battle of revenge is on, with weapons escalating from knives to guns and eventually to rocket launchers and beyond. A pitch-black comedy of violence filled with rage at the status quo and a seething impatience for the ordinary, KARAOKE TERROR captures the angst and spiritual restlessness of two very different generations, both abandoned by society and seeking payback with apocalyptic results.",,"Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Ryûhei Matsuda",,,,,,6.5,1,Synapse Films

While this made-for-TV movie isn't terribly ambitious, it does provide a credible look at how Barnum came to find that his calling in life was to dazzle people with things they could scarcely believe, all the time making sure that they paid handsomely to be ""humbugged."" As an ambitious youth at a time when America was enjoying explosive growth, Barnum's burgeoning career took off when he bought what was essentially a museum of freaks and frauds. As charmingly portrayed by Bridges, Barnum was a bundle of energy who instinctively knew what people wanted, and he unfailingly turned his acts, such as the famed midget Tom Thumb or the great soprano Jenny Lind, into national obsessions. This film captures the varied facets of Barnum's personality, from a natural playfulness that inspired his fantastic publicity stunts to a shrewd sense of business that could made him one of the wealthiest Americans of his time. And as Barnum was something of an emblematic American, this story of his life not only portrays a unique personality, but evokes the exuberant and growing American nation.

Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent selling neuro-toxic food additives to the public.

B000065KB0,Black Robe,,English,,,,,"Forget about Kevin Costner's sun-kissed, water-colored, Oscar-winning Dances with Wolves. Black Robe, which was directed by Bruce Beresford, a director who gave the world the finest film of the early '80s Australian new wave, Breaker Morant, and who continually collides cultures and ethnicity in his films (Mister Johnson, Driving Miss Daisy), matches and surpasses the Costner epic as an expertly crafted, brutal saga of redemption and salvation. In 1634 a young French Jesuit missionary is assigned to trek 1,500 miles through the New France wilderness to a mission settled in Huron Indian country. Black Robe chronicles the journey of Father Laforgue (Lothaire Blutheau) as he leaves his Jesuit brothers and, with the aid of a young translator and guide, Daniel (Aden Young), and eight canoes of Algonquin Indians, moves into the uncompromising Canadian northern territory on a die-hard mission to convert the natives. Mixing elements of Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans and Roland Joffé's The Mission, Beresford offers a restless tale of Laforgue's conflicted faith juxtaposed against the sublime spiritual harmony with the land that the Huron and Algonquin already hold. Black Robe dances to its own drummer and is tuned into the precarious balance between nature's mystery and spirit and the strident, unyielding religious ethic. The cinematography by Peter James is relentlessly cruel and bleak, but it absolutely conveys the obstacles that face the idealistic and blind young priest, who by the end, has faced his own awakening. The film also features one of the late, great composer Georges Delerue's most noble scores.",,,,,,Mystery & Thrillers,,7.1,,

When she volunteers to help, Lefty persuades her to play the tape on-air to lure the maniacs out of hiding. But what she doesn't know is that she's the only witness to this diabolical family's butchery who hasn't been carved up for somebody's supper... just yet!

It can only wait, having been concealed in the shadows for years. In fact, its milieu is darkness. Only in it can it show itself and move. It even takes its name: DARKNESS. It's lived here since someone tried to call it, more than forty years ago. Because this house hides a secret, a terrible past, an inconceivably evil act. Seven children, faceless people, a circle that must be completed. And blood, lots of blood... But something went wrong. One of the children got away. The circle wasn't completed. That's why what lives here isn't finished. It's just waiting...It tries to carry out what it couldn't before, making plans in the shadows, to become complete, to be, to exist. A new family has just moved into the house. A small child. An unstable father capable of losing his temper at any time. A perfect target. The right place at the right time. The pieces only have to be put in place. And then wait. Maybe the family's daughter will be able to discover the truth; the dark secret of the past, the sinister conspiracy, the truth about what threatens them. Why is the father getting worse? What is her little brother afraid of? Why doesn't her mother listen to her? And why do the lights keep going out? It could be that nothing happens by chance, that everything has been worked out from the start. A devilish plan, precise and exact like a time-bomb. Her father's illness, the house, the circles, the children. Perhaps she can foresee darkness' master stroke of play and the inevitable destiny that is closing in on her family. But maybe it's too late....","Giancarlo Giannini, Miguel Tejada-Flores, Fernando de Felipe, Anna Paquin, Francesc Pags, Iain Glen, Stephan Enquist, Gemma Lozano, Jaume Balaguer, Fele Martnez, Lena Olin, Craig Stevenson, Xavier Allepuz, Ferm Reixach, Paula Fernndez","Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Iain Glen, Giancarlo Giannini, Fele Martnez",,,,,,5.4,,Dimension

The result is a marvelous retelling of baseball in America as seen from the ground--the culture of stadiums, the ritual of afternoon games, the spiritually sustaining rivalries. Somewhat enthralled by the images at its disposal, the film has a way of almost stepping back from itself, waxing poetic at a sighting of the St. Louis Cardinals' ""Gashouse Gang,"" or a glimpse of Bogart and Bacall in the stands, or the legendary contests between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. Among the truly unexpected sights is color footage of the 1938 World Series (Cubs versus Yanks), not only from inside the stadium walls but from the street as traffic cops, crowds, and vehicles amassed. There's also an interesting chapter on World War II's impact on the game, particularly with the odd marketing gimmicks that were intended to keep fans involved while many of the best players were fighting overseas. Of course, there are the heroes, too, often caught in relaxed, unselfconscious moments through the lens of a teammate or a true believer in the bleachers. A great experience all around.

What the Chinese-Canadian filmmaker saw in 2002 will disappear in subsequent years as the rising waters of the Three Gorges Dam submerge the villages along the riverbanks. Chang takes a two-pronged approach in shadowing a pair of luxury liner workers, petite 16-year-old Yu Shui (renamed Cindy) and rangy 19-year-old Chen Bo Yu (Jerry), concentrating most of his attentions on the former. While the shy Yu Shui caters to the needs of well-heeled Westerners in order to assist her poverty-stricken family, her relations make plans to leave Fengdu before the Yangtze swoops in (the outspoken Chen Bo Yu hails from the similarly threatened Kai Xian). As the landscape around them turns into a second Atlantis, the teenagers change, as well, in ways both positive and negative. To survive in modern-day China, it appears, Westernization is inevitable, which Chang (third-generation Canadian) neither celebrates nor condemns. Instead, he questions the ways in which economic progress erodes--sometimes even destroys--personal and cultural values. In the illuminating booklet interview that accompanies the DVD, Chang admits he was inspired by the large-scale Three Gorges photography of fellow Canadian Edward Burtynsky, which makes the more intimate ",,"Cindy Shui Yu, Jerry Bo Yu Chen",,,"Widescreen, Anamorphic, Color, NTSC, Multiple Formats, Subtitled",Action & Adventure/Thrillers,,7.5,,Zeitgeist Films

Dealing with much darker subject matter than most of its contemporaries, such as divorce, infidelity, and nightlife, this film is a priceless look at the evolving values of the nineteen thirties. The film moves along at a brisk pace, beginning with a husband who's messing around and busted by his newly married wife. She leaves him and goes to Reno because the divorce process is easier there (scary stuff for the thirties!). But while staying in Reno, she takes a stroll through the illicit scene in The Biggest Little City in the World. Plenty of smoking and gambling, with implicit sexual misconduct, are all on display to the eye-opening wonderment of our heroine. As she becomes embroiled in nasty affairs, her husband returns to attempt to pull things back together. Since the Night Life in Reno takes an honest and not morally righteous look at divorce, it was met with tremendous resistance from religious groups. Now, it serves as a wonderful benchmark for morality in early twentieth century America.",,Jameson Thomas,,,,,,,,"Quality Information Publishers, Inc."

THE GREEK HOLOCAUST: 1915-1922 The modern day genocide of the Greeks of the Pontos and Micra Asia (Asia Minor). On September 8, 1922 the Muslim Ottoman Turks committed the first case of modern day genocide and ethnic cleansing. It began with the genocide of over one million Armenian Christians around 1915. Between 1915 and 1922 over 350,000 Greek Orthodox Christians of the Pontos and up to 1,500,000 Greek Orthodox Christians of Micra Asia (Asia Minor) were exterminated by forced death marches and burnings. Holocaust, which comes from the Greek word ""olokaftoma,"" means total consumption by fire. This is not an historical documentary as much as it is a collection of archival video/film footage of interviews of people and/or the documenting public events. Please understand this is the only copy of these interviews as the film masters were lost long ago. Therefore, the video quality is not as would be expected from today's video standards. Please understand that it is what is said (stories, many by eyewitnesses) and reported that is more important than picture quality. We hope that the survivors who share their memories and stories of unspeakable pain will help the world remember this grotesque crime. As we honor the 100-year centennial anniversary of the horror of the Greek holocaust, we offer this film as a memorial to the Greek Orthodox victims of the Pontos and Micra Asia (modern day Turkey) CelebrateGreece.com ships DVD's Worldwide.

B000UP8836,The Chomsky Sessions: Noam Chomsky On The World,,English,,"November 18, 2008",NR,,"One of the most respected intellectuals of the 20th century, Noam Chomsky has had a long and prolific career as a linguist, philosopher, and political activist. Undoubtedly, though, he is best known as the quintessential American dissident. Chomsky's criticism of U.S. foreign policy began with the Vietnam War and continued over the span of the next 40 years (and roughly as many books). NOAM CHOMSKY ON THE WORLD delves into the mind of the man himself through a series of candid interviews, lectures, and classroom discussions in which he traces the entire arc of 20th-century American politics, from 1920s public policy to 9/11. Even more importantly, the professor emeritus sketches out a history of resistance and struggle that is fundamental to his political thought and, he claims, to the ""civilizing"" of America. Disarmingly straightforward, tremendously informed, and profoundly insightful, Chomsky has the rare ability to illuminate larger patterns and systems, bringing viewers to a far deeper understanding of history, power, and the uniquely American privilege of protest. Thoroughly absorbing and edifying, NOAM CHOMSKY ON THE WORLD profiles the luminous thinking of a man who has spent his life striving to educate, to empower, and ultimately, to liberate.",,Noam Chomsky,,,"NTSC, Multiple Formats, Color",Military & War,,,,Docurama

6304683162,Not Wanted (1949) [VHS],,,,"June 27, 2000",,,"Actress Ida Lupino became an accidental auteur when director Elmer Clifton suffered a heart attack three days into the production of this independent feature, which Lupino cowrote (with later blacklistee Paul Jarrico) and coproduced. It was the beginning of a second career for Lupino, who quietly became the only woman director working in Hollywood in the 1950s. Lupino effortlessly transfers the unsentimental pragmatism of her screen character to this surprisingly distanced account of an unhappy young woman (newcomer Sally Forrest) who runs away from her stifling small-town home. She dreams of joining the surly, sexy jazz pianist (Leo Penn, in a performance that strikingly anticipates the work of his son Sean) but has to settle for the fey attentions of boyish gas-pump jockey Keefe Brasselle, whose idea of fun runs more to toy trains and merry-go-rounds. Lupino uses extremely long takes to highlight the character's sense of isolation and entrapment, but her standoffish camera never allows the film to descend to melodramatic pathos, even when the girl discovers she's pregnant and seeks refuge in a prisonlike home for unwed mothers. Among the film's many astonishing protofeminist moments is a vision of childbirth as blurry expressionist nightmare. ",,"Forrest, Brasselle, Penn",,,,,,6.8,,Kino Video

B007AJMC4Q,Rampart,,,,"May 15, 2012",R,,"At the heart of Oren Moverman's RAMPART is a riveting parable about what happens to a man who refuses to change, even when change is the only thing that can save him. That man is Dave Brown, played by two-time Academy Award® nominee Woody Harrelson. Though the film is set in the 1990s, when scandal rocked the LAPD's Rampart division, the film hones in on a single fictional cop: Dave Brown, a man who has taken the ''no guts, no glory'' American mythos to heart, without questioning what it is doing to him and those he holds dear. He is a cop whose personal life is propelled into a dizzying downward spiral when he comes under suspicion for roughing up a suspect. More than just a police officer who plays things fast and loose, Brown exposes the inner workings of a certain type of personality everyone recognizes around them, a personality very much part of American culture, yet not often examined. He is the kind of man inexorably drawn to authority and power, yet seems destined to abuse it; a man who has dreams of being a great masculine hero, yet is beholden to women; who has undeniable charm, yet whose stubborn refusal to take responsibility for his actions becomes a destructive force against family, community and ultimately himself.",,"Woody Harrelson, Robin Wright, Steve Buscemi, Sigourney Weaver, Ben Foster",,,,,,5.8,1,Alchemy / Millennium

Well, it worked. For over 90 minutes, you feel like you're sitting right in the middle of Miami's cavernous Joe Robbie Stadium. The sound cuts in and out, you can't understand a word Mick says, the fans' screams are louder than Keith, Ronnie, and Charlie's playing, and the only real pleasure is watching close-ups of the aging band's still-energized antics on a screen. The boys look like they're having a blast, especially when guest guitarists Robert Cray and Bo Diddley join them for such classics as Robert Johnson's ""Stop Breaking Down,"" and ""Who Do You Love."" But the audio transfer here continually frustrates and baffles. It best resembles an audience bootleg tape. The Stones may have been too concerned with the show's visual production value because the real reason to watch the thing, the music, pales in comparison. They've got giant snakes breathing fire, screens flashing computer animation, ramps, ledges, suggestive backup singers, and enough costume changes that ""Las Vegas Lounge"" would have been a more apt tour moniker.

It shows that these guys are in it primarily for the love of the sport. For example, they stop to skate a full-pipe they randomly spot sticking out of the middle of nowhere. There aren't any other skaters there, just them in this huge dirty pipe not even made for skating. A big plus is Rodney Mullen, inventor of the kickflip and the heelflip and just about everything else heh. And, we get to see Tony's son Riley more heavily featured than ever before; the little guy throws down double kickflips like they were nothing! There's a menu of extras to explore. Some of the funny ones include Kerry Getz and his tantrum induced shoe-beating/board-smashing breakdowns, and also former pro Jeff Petit who can land stuff every once in a while, but it's way more funny when he doesn't. Tony gets really worked on this tour. He breaks his ankle and suffers a nasty 12"" laceration to the shin, but then he keeps on skating of course. Hey, if you ever wanted to see Tony's fresh tibia, now's your chance! I really enjoyed this video and I hope Tony stays healthy, keeps touring, and never stops making these great DVDs.",,Tony Hawk,,,,,,,,Yont Hawk

Erstwhile tomboy June Allyson stars as Alcott's famed heroine Jo, the budding writer in Civil War New England who pines for adventure, independence, and her own career. With Father off to war, it's up to Jo, practical older sister Meg (Janet Leigh), frail sister Beth (Margaret O'Brien), and vain sister Amy (Elizabeth Taylor) to help Marmee (a saintly Mary Astor) keep the home fires warm while dealing with the rigors of adolescence. It's all poured on with a generous amount of syrup, including lavish sets, hoop skirts, and petticoats, but anyone who's ever read Alcott's book will take comfort in its familiar story line. The dialogue is clunky but earnest, but you'd have to have a heart of stone not to get caught up in Jo's plight. And rarely do you get to see such stars go at it with such gusto: Allyson and Peter Lawford (as neighbor and rich boy Laurie) are a match made in B-movie heaven, Taylor is spunky and hilarious in an early comic performance, and Leigh does the matronly thing with aplomb.

Pompeii and Herculaneum were lost beneath gravel and ash until relatively recently. Now archaeologists consider Pompeii the largest preserved site of the ancient world. In this hour-long program, originally released in 1987, much is methodically explored. In Herculaneum a baby's cradle, delicate hand-blown glass, and a lunchtime meal are all intact. How did ancient Romans live and how did Vesuvius kill them? Viewers will learn all this and more about the last moments of life near Europe's most active volcano.

B0000ACP0J,Mussolini and I [VHS],,,,"August 26, 2003",Unrated,,"The darkest days of World War II set the backdrop for this epic story about the turbulent life and death of Benito Mussolini (Bob Hoskins, Mona Lisa, The Long Good Friday), Italys fascist dictator known as Il Duce. This compelling, historic drama takes place in war-torn Italy and traces Mussolinis vacillating relationship with his son-in-law, Count Galeazzo Ciano (Academy Award®-winner Anthony Hopkins, The Silence of the Lambs), whose anti-Nazi sentiments place him, his family and Il Duce in great jeopardy. Academy Award®-winner Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking, Thelma and Louise) plays Edda, the spoiled yet passionate daughter of Il Duce, who is torn between her love for her husband and her father. Pressed by his advisors and Germanys Hitler to rid himself of the rebellious Ciano, Il Duce is forced to sign the order for his son-in-laws arrest for high treason. But Edda holds Cianos incriminating diaries that can spell doom for Il Duce and his fascist cause. This four part factual drama reveals the dictator as a complex but flawed leader  a hero to his people, a traitor to his country and a loving father who allows politics to force him to doom the son-in-law whom he loves dearly. Most telling is the dictators admiration of Hitler  the flaw that eventually seals his fate.","Dietlinde Turban, Franco Mazzieri, Lionello Pio Di Savoia, Paolo Maria Scalondro, Riccardo Peloso, Carlheinz Heitmann, Ted Rusoff, Livio Galassi, Massimo Dapporto, Marne Maitland, Gianni Baghino, Franco Fabrizi, Antonella Angelucci, Robert Sommer, David-George Brown, Olliver Domnick, Eric Valsecchi, Vittorio Mezzogiorno, Hans-Dieter Asner, Micaela Giustiniani (II), Harald Dietl, Gian-Polo Vetturini, Alberto Negrin, Barbara De Rossi, Carolyn De Fonseca, Diego Verdegiglio, Francesca Rinaldi, Stefano De Sando, Fabio Testi, Gianni Pulone, Julian Jenkins, Anthony Hopkins, Pietro Sarubbi, Ljupco Todorovski, Bob Hoskins, Enrico Papa, Annie Girardot, Luca Orlandini, Susan Sarandon, Manuela Mortera, Franco Meroni, Kurt Raab, Ulisse Minervini, Leslie Thomas, Piero Palermini","Susan Sarandon, Anthony Hopkins, Bob Hoskins, Annie Girardot, Barbara De Rossi",,,,,,6.2,,KOCH VISION

Thankfully, he breaks loose (of course), but unfortunately, this doesn't contribute any momentum to the story. Rather, we're treated to more scenes of men with hats hanging out at the police station drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, pointing at maps, answering phone calls, smoking more cigarettes, drinking coffee, pointing at more maps...and to the same shot of the snow beast emerging to and fro the shadows, the same shot played over and over again, forwards and in reverse.""","Robert Hinton, Teru Shimada, Myles Wilder, Rudolph Anders, Keith Richards, W.

Kyle Jason does just that with his own unique blend of Soul, Jazz, Blues, Funk and good ol Rock and Roll. He is also dedicated to the stage and regularly works a crowd to a sweaty exhilarating exhaustion. The CD/DVD is a perfect vehicle for Revolution Of The Cool, in that its a must see album as well as must hear.

B001L57ZZQ,The Duchess,,"English, Spanish, French",,,PG-13,1 hour and 50 minutes,"Swaddled in whalebone and wigs, Keira Knightley steps into the restricted world of the Duchess of Devonshire, a royal lady popular with her subjects but stuck in an unhappy marriage. If this situation recalls Princess Diana (a descendent of the Duchess's family), so much the better for the purposes of director Saul Dibb and company; this film is eager to draw parallels with the unfortunate Lady Di, even if she is never directly mentioned. Knightley's unsuspecting girl is married off to the Duke (Ralph Fiennes), a distracted jerk who craves sons, and obviously has never thought of women as anything other than a means to achieve an heir. When the Duchess launches her procreative career with a couple of daughters, well, the Duke begins to get nervous--and partners outside the marriage become increasingly appealing.
